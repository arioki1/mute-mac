# Mute Me
Use the touch bar, a menubar icon or a keyboard shortcut to mute/unmute your Mac's microphone.

### Use Case

When you’re in a meeting using Hangouts, Skype, Slack, or another voice application, it's good practice to stay on mute until someone speaks to you directly - especially if you’re meeting with three or more people. Often, however, you'll need to browse between multiple tabs, and it can take too long to switch back to the meeting app to unmute your microphone. With Mute Me, you can mute or unmute your mic quickly and easily, right from your Touch Bar.

### Options
- use long tap on the Touch Bar icon to open Preferences
- find the Open at Login option in Preferences
- add custom shortcut for Mute/Unmute (default cmd + shift + 0) in Preferences
- show/hide Mute/Unmute button in MacOS menu bar in Preferences
- configure functionality to Mute/Unmute by left clicking icon in MacOS menu bar (right click to open menu) in Preferences
- configure alternate set of icons for MacOS menu bar (for those that prefer monochromatic icons) in Preferences

### Please note:
